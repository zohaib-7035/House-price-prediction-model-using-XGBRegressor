## House Price Prediction

This project focuses on predicting house prices using the California Housing Dataset from Scikit-learn. The dataset includes features such as median income, house age, average number of rooms and bedrooms per household, population, average household occupancy, and geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude). The workflow involves loading the dataset, preprocessing it by converting it into a Pandas DataFrame, checking for missing values, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA). A heatmap is used to analyze feature correlations. The data is then split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets using `train_test_split()`. The model is trained using the XGBoost Regressor (`XGBRegressor()`), and its performance is evaluated using R² Score (Coefficient of Determination) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The model's effectiveness is further visualized through scatter plots comparing actual and predicted values. With an R² Score of approximately 0.81, the model demonstrates a good fit. To run the project, required dependencies such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, and xgboost need to be installed. Users can clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and run the script. Future improvements include experimenting with different models (Random Forest, LightGBM, Neural Networks), performing hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, and deploying the model as a web application. This project is developed by [Your Name], a data science enthusiast.
